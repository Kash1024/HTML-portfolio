<h1>Kash's Top Three Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time are:
</h2>
<hr/>
<h2>John Wick </h2>
<p>John Wick a movie with 4 sequals that expresses the life
    of an assassin  who after losing his wife, seems to
    encounter the worst and is forced to get even. He then wants to leave the assassin committee
to just be done with all the killing. 
</p>
<h2>Salt</h2>
<p>This movie stars my favorite actress Angelina Jolie 
    who plays as a CIA agent who is actaully undercover for 
    a Russian spy. She finds love in America, but once the Russian doomsday comes
    and they look for her, they kill her lover which then forces her
    to find Her Russian family and kill them.
</p>
<h2>Lucy</h2>
<p>Lucy is one of my most favorites because it gives an 
    idea of what humans could be capable of if we were able 
    to use 100% of our brain.
